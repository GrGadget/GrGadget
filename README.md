ðŸ‘‹ **Hello, I'm Mark from the UK.**

I'm passionate about coding, solving puzzles, chess, maths, and snooker. Logical thinking combined with creativity drives me to keep learning, push boundaries, and build better systems. 

ðŸ’¡ **My Tech Journey**  
- My coding journey began with [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/), a fantastic entry-level computer science course that laid the foundation for my passion for software development.  
- Eager to dive deeper into coding, I taught myself Python and built various projects to apply what I learned.  
- I completed the [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/) bootcamp, mastering JavaScript and gaining strong web development skills.  
- I've now spent **a couple of years working extensively with TypeScript**, building a range of front-end and back-end projects. One of my proudest achievements is developing a **commissioned SaaS project** from scratch.  
- I successfully completed **Advent of Code 2023**, which helped sharpen my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills.  

```javascript
let codingSkills = {
    languages: ["Python", "JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Go"],
    webDevelopment: ["HTML", "CSS", "React", "NextJs", "Node.js", "Express"],
    testing: ["React Testing Library", "Jest", "Mocha"],
    tools: ["VS Code", "GitHub", "Docker"],
    concepts: ["Data Structures", "Algorithms", "Problem Solving", "API Design", "TDD", "System Design"],
    achievements: ["SaaS Development", "Advent of Code 2023", "2+ years TypeScript experience"]
};
```

ðŸ‘€ **Interests Beyond Coding**  
- **Puzzles**: Whether it's a crossword or a Rubik's cube (best time: 28 seconds), I love a good challenge.  
- **Chess**: A keen player with a current rating of **1498**. I'm always seeking to improve my tactics.  
- **Snooker**: My highest break is **62**, and the game teaches me a lot about focus and strategy.  
- **Maths**: The logical beauty of mathematics never ceases to captivate me.  
- **Reading**: Iâ€™m a huge fan of Stephen King, often losing myself in the chilling and gripping stories he crafts.

```javascript
let personalInterests = {
    chessRating: 1498,
    highestSnookerBreak: 62,
    bestRubiksTime: "28 seconds",
    favoritePuzzles: ["Crosswords", "Rubik's cube", "Sudoku"],
    favoriteAuthor: "Stephen King"
};
```

ðŸ”­ **Looking Forward**  
With a couple of years of TypeScript experience under my belt and exciting projects like the SaaS development completed, I'm eager to continue growing. I'm looking forward to tackling more complex challenges, refining my system design skills, and building efficient, scalable solutions.
