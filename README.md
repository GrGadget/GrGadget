ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Mark from the UK.

```
I'm passionate about coding, puzzles, chess, maths, and snooker. Being able to combine logical thinking and creativity motivates me to learn new things and push my boundaries. 

ðŸ’¡ **My Tech Journey**
- I got my start in coding through [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/), an entry-level course for computer science.
- To deepen my understanding of Python, I spent time self-studying and applying what I learned.
- Eager to broaden my skills, I joined [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/) bootcamp, where I dove into JavaScript and developed a solid foundation in web development.
- Currently, I'm expanding my programming language repertoire by exploring TypeScript and Go.

```javascript
let codingSkills = {
    languages: ["Python", "JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Go"],
    webDevelopment: ["HTML", "CSS", "React", "NextJs", "Node.js", "Express"],
    testing: ["React Testing Library", "Jest", "Mocha"],
    tools: ["VS Code", "GitHub", "Docker"],
    concepts: ["Data Structures", "Algorithms", "Problem Solving", "API Design", "TDD"]
};
```
ðŸŒ± **What I'm Learning Now**
- Digging deeper into the world of back end development and front end skills, I'm focusing on mastering TypeScript and Go.
- My aim is to build efficient, performant, and robust systems that can handle scale.
- I enjoy challenging myself with coding problems on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).

ðŸ‘€ **Interests Beyond Coding**
- **Puzzles**: Love to challenge my brain with all kinds of puzzles. My best Rubik's cube time is 28 seconds (can still do it under a minute).
- **Chess**: An avid player with a current rating of 1498. Always up for a game!
- **Snooker**: My highest break is 62. Snooker is not just a game, it's a way to think strategically.
- **Maths**: I find the logic and structure of math immensely satisfying.
- **Reading**: I enjoy diving into the chilling worlds created by Stephen King.

```javascript
let personalInterests = {
    chessRating: 1498,
    highestSnookerBreak: 62,
    bestRubiksTime: "28 seconds",
    favoritePuzzles: ["Crosswords", "Rubik's cube", "Sudoku"],
    favoriteAuthor: "Stephen King"
};
```
ðŸ”­ **Looking Forward**
My journey as a developer is just starting. I'm excited about the potential for growth, the challenges ahead, and the contributions I can make along the way.
